## About

* This widget performs a hue rotation on the child's color:
* `Degrees` defines the number of degrees around the color circle the color will be adjusted.
* A value of 0 leaves the color unchanged.
* A value of 180 paints the complementary color.
* The manipulated color in the example is `Colors.blue`.
